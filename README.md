# Angular 17 with my favourite new features

Simple app with all schematics refactored to new flow control syntax and other new features that interest me.

## New Flow Control

I refactored schematics provided by angular material to new flow control syntax.

## Using withViewTransitions()

Check out app.config.ts to see how to add new transition feature to your app (As of now, it doesn't work on Safari, Chrome seems fine).


## How to run

- git clone repo
- cd into cloned folder
- npm ci || npm install
- ng s
